      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>A federal agency conducts inspections of retailers to determine a retailer's compliance with federal laws and regulations. One aspect of compliance is to determine if a retailer is compliant with the sale of age restricted merchandise. Undercover buy inspections are performed to determine if an establishment violates federal laws and regulations. Inspection results are available in a web based, case management system (CMS). As long as a retailer is in business, multiple inspections can be associated with it.</p>
      <p>Results from compliance check inspections are used to determine if a retailer is compliant with laws and regulations. If the inspection indicates a potential violation may have occurred, the agency reviews the retailer’s inspection and history before an action is taken against the retailer (warning, monetary penalty, or suspension of sale of regulated merchandise).</p>
      <p>As part of the review process, an analyst completes a word document form of predefined questions and then uploads the document in the CMS to be associated with the inspection. Multiple levels of review can occur before a final decision is reached.</p>

      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Create a minimum viable product that incorporates the review form document into the CMS as part of the review process. The input from the review document should be visible and editable for the next level of review. </p>
      
      <h3>The Approach</h3>
      <h4>User Flow</h4>
      <p>Once the requirements were set, I updated the user flow to include the review form as part of the web application. This eliminated the step to upload and associate the review document to the inspection under review. I created a series of low-fidelity wireframes and a wireflow to show how a user would go through the review process.</p>

        <p>Wireflow of user interaction with web application.</p>
      </figure>
      <h4>UI Design</h4>
      <p>I proposed the UI option for capturing the review analysis within the application. Because the analyst would like to have a side by side view of the retailer’s information and review form, I place the form to overlap the some of the content. The analyst can toggle between the retailer’s information and the review form.</p>

      <h3>The Response</h3>
      <p>The Business Analyst and I presented the updated user flow and wireframes to the stakeholders and received a positive response to the design presented. The first version of the review form went into production a few months later.</p>
