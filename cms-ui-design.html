        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          A federal agency conducts inspections of retailers to determine a
          retailer's compliance with federal laws and regulations. One aspect of
          compliance is to determine if a retailer is compliant with the sale of
          age restricted merchandise. Undercover buy inspections are performed
          to determine if an establishment violates federal laws and
          regulations. Inspection results are available in a web based, case
          management system (CMS). As long as a retailer is in business,
          multiple inspections can be associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results from compliance check inspections are used to determine if a
          retailer is compliant with laws and regulations. If the inspection
          indicates a potential violation may have occurred, the agency reviews
          the retailer’s inspection and history before an action is taken
          against the retailer (warning, monetary penalty, or suspension of sale
          of regulated merchandise).
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the review process, an analyst completes a word document
          form of predefined questions and then uploads the document in the CMS
          to be associated with the inspection. Multiple levels of review can
          occur before a final decision is reached.
        </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Create a minimum viable product that incorporates the review form
          document into the CMS as part of the review process. The input from
          the review document should be visible and editable for the next level
          of review.
        </p>

        <h3>The Approach</h3>
        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>
          Once the requirements were set, I updated the user flow to include the
          review form as part of the web application. This eliminated the step
          to upload and associate the review document to the inspection under
          review. I created a series of low-fidelity wireframes and a wireflow
          to show how a user would go through the review process.
        </p>

          <img src="images/cms-wireflow.png" alt="Wireflow" />
          <p>Wireflow of user interaction with web application.</p>
        </figure>
        <h4>UI Design</h4>
        <p>
          I proposed the UI option for capturing the review analysis within the
          application. Because the analyst would like to have a side by side
          view of the retailer’s information and review form, I place the form
          to overlap the some of the content. The analyst can toggle between the
          retailer’s information and the review form.
        </p>

        <figure class="center add-padding">
          <img src="images/cms-ui-design.png" alt="Proposed UI Design" />
          <p>Proposed UI Design.</p>
        </figure>

        <h3>The Response</h3>
        <p>
          The Business Analyst and I presented the updated user flow and
          wireframes to the stakeholders and received a positive response to the
          design presented. The first version of the review form went into
          production a few months later.
