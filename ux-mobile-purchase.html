            In January 2019, I attended a three-day course, “User Experience
            (UX) Design Training for Successful Software Development” provided
            by Learning Tree. This an exercise I completed myself after
            returning home. I have summarized the necessary background
            information as best as I can without giving the whole course content
            away (for free).

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          As Roadworthy has grown to a half-billion–dollar company with
          thousands of employees, their goal continues to be to provide
          high-end, technologically sophisticated solutions for the real
          problems that their customers face at a low cost. The company’s vision
          is “Democratizing technology for the trucking industry”—making
          solutions that were available only to large truck fleets available to
          our customers: mid-size, and even small, truck fleets.
        </p>
        <h4>The WADI Line of Products</h4>
        <p>
          The Wide Area Driver Information (WADI) system consists primarily of
          data-gathering devices. The data-gathering devices are attached to
          trucks to gather and broadcast information about those vehicles. Data
          collected from the devices are available once the vehicle enters or
          leaves the business’ place of operation. Each data-gathering model is
          designed to gather specific data (e.g., mileage, tire pressure, brake
          stroke, etc.). Customers can order these products online using the
          purchasing web application developed in house.
        </p>

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          Design an application so a truck business can place an order on a
          mobile device.
        </p>

        <h3>The Approach</h3>
        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <p>
          Using the background information provided, I created a persona, Abe
          Abrams. I describe Abe as a twenty something year old mechanic who has
          been in the field for six years. Most of the times, he knows the
          device he needs to order but sometimes has difficulty identifying the
          device especially when it is damaged. He wants to order the correct
          devices with minimal effort.
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
          <em
            >A truck just rolled into the yard with visible damage to its right
            fender. Abe walks out of his office to check on his driver and the
            truck. The driver admits that he skimmed a guardrail to avoid a
            vehicle that was merging aggressively into his lane. No one was hurt
            and the damage looks superficial. Abe wants to know which device are
            still working without having to uninstall each device. Abe pulls his
            phone out of his vest and opens the WADI mobile app.</em
          >
        </p>
        <h4>UI Design</h4>
        <p>
          For this activity, I decided to create the user flow, or the steps,
          Abe would take in order to complete a purchase using the Roadworthy
          mobile app. For the scenario, I assumed that Abe already had an
          existing Roadworthy account that was tied to his company's account.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user flow started with the three possible scenarios of logging
          into the Roadworthy app.
        </p>
        <figure class="center add-padding">
          <img
            src="images/roadworthy-ui-mobile-login-small.png"
            alt="Mobile UI Design Login Screen. Three possible user flows: Account Creation, Login Existing User, Forgot Password"
          />
          <p>
            Mobile UI Design Login Screen. Three possible user flows: Account
            Creation, Login Existing User, Forgot Password
          </p>
        </figure>
        <p>
          After logging into the Roadworthy app, Abe would see a the page "My
          Fleet" which listed the trucks that are owned by his company. Abe
          could either scroll to find the truck that needs new devices or he
          could take a picture of the truck's license plate number using the
          phone's built in camera. After taking a picture of the truck's license
          plate number, the system retrieves the truck's information which
          includes all WADI devices that are installed on the truck. The app
          identifies which devices are broadcasting a signal and which are not.
          Abe can then select the disconnected device, view the product
          information, select the quantity to order, and select where the device
          should be delivered.
        </p>
