        <h2>I am a Front End Developer.</h2>   
        <p>I build out the visual components of a website. This means, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Sometimes this includes integrating a CMS. Although my main focus is the presentation layer, I am capable of filling in the user experience and visual design blanks as needed. I enjoy working with application developers and visual artists often serving as the bridge between the technical and the artistic worlds.</p>
        <p>Offline, I pursue many interests. I attribute this to my love of learning. A few interests <em>do</em> turn into hobbies. I enjoy baking, sewing, learning how to use my DSLR, and lifting heavy things.</p>
