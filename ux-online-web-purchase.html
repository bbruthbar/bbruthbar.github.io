			<div class="callout">
				<p>In January 2019, I attended a three-day course, “User Experience (UX) Design Training for Successful Software Development” provided by Learning Tree. This is the exercise I completed with three other students who attended the course in person. We received feedback from our instructor as well the students who attended and completed the courses virtually. I have summarized the necessary background information as best as I can without giving the whole course content away (for free).</p>

			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>As Roadworthy has grown to a half-billion–dollar company with thousands of employees, their goal continues to be to provide high-end, technologically sophisticated solutions for the real problems that their customers face at a low cost. The company’s vision is “Democratizing technology for the trucking industry”—making solutions that were available only to large truck fleets available to our customers: mid-size, and even small, truck fleets.</p>
			<h4>The WADI Line of Products</h4>
			<p>The Wide Area Driver Information (WADI) system consists primarily of data-gathering devices. The data-gathering devices are attached to trucks to gather and broadcast information about those vehicles. Data collected from the devices are available once the vehicle enters or leaves the business’ place of operation. Each data-gathering model is designed to gather specific data (e.g., mileage, tire pressure, brake stroke, etc.). Customers can order these products online using the purchasing web application developed in house.</p>
				
			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
			<p>The runaway success of the WADI devices has exposed issues with the existing customer ordering application. Most customers complain that they have difficulty finding the correct product or they cannot determine if a product fits their truck. Customers often have truck fleet which are located in different cities, but the online orders are delivered to only one location. The challenge is to improve WADI's online ordering experience so customers can order devices that are compatible with their truck fleet and have it delivered to the correct location.</p>
			
			<h3>The Approach</h3>
			<h4>Persona</h4>
			<p>My team and I created a person, Jonas Johansson. We described our persona as a senior citizen who is old fashioned, people-oriented, and perhaps not as tech-savvy. Jonas has deep experience as having been in the trucking business since he was in his twenties. He knows the devices each truck would need, but he only knows them by the device identification number (SKU#). The WADI system does not list the device id number on their application so Jonas cannot confirm if it is the correct device he needs. He wants to be as efficient as much as possible without making too many errors for ordering one device. Ordering the wrong device would delay getting the truck back on the road again.</p>

			<h4>Scenario</h4>
			<p>The next step was to create a scenario for the persona. The scenario described how Jonas would carry out the task of ordering devices for his trucks located in four cities using the existing WADI application. The scenario described Jonas frustration in making sure he was ordering the correct device for his truck. It also described how he had to repeat the same steps in ordering the devices that needs to be shipped to another location.</p>

			<h4>Interaction Script</h4>
			<p>My team and I created a list of actions that will be performed by our persona in the scenario we created previously. It described the actions Jonas would take and the response either from Jonas or the WADI online ordering system. It also identified potential barriers in completing the task at hand. My team and I generated ideas that would address the barriers.</p>

			<h4>UI Design</h4>

			</figure>
			<p>My team and I decided to design the WADI product page to address Jonas's pain points during ordering. We assumed a few pre-requisites/features that existed prior to ordering an item. First, Jonas should be able to save to his account the types of trucks he owns (i.e. truck make, model, year, license plate id). Then by viewing a truck from his fleet, the WADI system should return a list of compatible devices. Jonas can then review each compatible device to determine how many he wants to purchase and where it should be delivered.</p>

			<p>Our UI design included displaying the device name, the device ID (SKU#), compatibility with Jonas's existing truck, and the ability to deliver the device to a different location.</p>

			<h3>The Response</h3>
			<p>Throughout each step of the UX process, my team and I shared our results with our instructor and the students who attended the course virtually.</p>
