# Online resume of Ruth Cirillo
* This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
* To run locally, you will need node and gulp installed. 
* This is just a basic website to show my resume and how I set up my workflow, and files. I realize I should have a dist (distribution) folder that have my files minimized, optimized, etc. except, I am still trying to figure out to to utilize Github pages to its full extent. If you know how to do subsites on github pages, let me know.
* Concerns, compliments, constructive criticism? Send me a message.
